# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
A Java Frame Application to visualize sorting algorithms.

This application implements java swing to draw out a visual of the process of loop sorting. There are interactive buttons to visualize different sorting algorithms and a slider to change the delay in between swaps. The height of each bar corresponds to its value and its x position corresponds to it's index in the array.

# Implemented Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
